    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans:-  Functions are advantegeous to have in programs for several reasons:\\\n",
    "'''\n",
    "1. Reusability : Functions allows us to encapsulate a specific set of instructions or behaior into a single unit that can be calle multiple times throughout our program.\n",
    "2. Abstraction : Functions allow us to abstract away complex logic and implementation details behind a simple interface.\n",
    "3. Readability and Maintainability: Breaking down your code into functions makes it more readable and easier to understand.\n",
    "4. Testing : Functions can be individually tested, which facilitates the debugging process.\n",
    "5. Modularity: Functions enable you to break down your program into smaller, self-contained modules.\n",
